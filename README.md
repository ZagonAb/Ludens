## 🧩 Inspiration

**Ludens** takes visual inspiration from [Ludo Frontend](https://ludo.libretro.com), an open-source game launcher developed by the **Libretro Team**.  
It reimagines Ludo’s minimalist look and feel within the [PixL-OS](https://www.pixl-os.com/) environment, adapting its design language for a smooth and modern user experience.
