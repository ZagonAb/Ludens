## 🧩 Inspiration

**Luden** is based on and closely follows the design of [Ludo Frontend](https://ludo.libretro.com), an open-source game launcher developed by the **Libretro Team**.  
It faithfully adapts Ludo’s minimalist interface and behavior to the **Pegasus Frontend** environment, ensuring compatibility and preserving the original visual identity.
